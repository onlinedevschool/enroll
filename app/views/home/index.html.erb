  <p><strong>Git</strong> is a tool used by developers to manage their projects in a 
  <strong>safe manner</strong> and it provides an important mechanism
  to <strong>backup code</strong> and <strong>retrieve lost work</strong>.</p>
  <p>It also allows <strong>multiple developers</strong> to work together on the same files at
  the same time <strong>without interfering</strong> with each other's work. You can even
  <strong>work offline</strong> and update when you get
  a connection.</p>
  <p>Since <strong>Git</strong> is a "cornerstone" tool, we start off teaching
  it right away, along with the <strong><a href="#" data-featherlight="#lbUnix">

  <p><strong>HTML</strong> is the backbone of the Interwebs. It is the <strong>structure and
    content</strong> element. You are right now reading words wrapped in <strong>
    HTML</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>HTML5</strong> makes huge strides in adding functionality to the webs like
  <strong>native video and audio</strong> without the use of Flash. There is even
  a spec to handle video conferencing called WebRTC!</p>

<div id="lbCss" class="feather">
  <img align="left" width="200px" src="<%= asset_path('technologies/css.png') %>">
  <p>If HTML is the backbone of the interwebs, then <strong>CSS</strong> is the
  clothes, hair, and possibly make-up, if you are into that.</p>
  <p>But <strong>CSS</strong> is more than just the color and typeface. It's also
  responsible for <strong>responsive design</strong> and element positioning in
  general. It is an invaluable skill when <strong>selling yourself</strong>
  as a new Web Developer.</p>

<div id="lbJs" class="feather">
  <img align="left" width="200px" src="<%= asset_path('technologies/javascript.png') %>">
  <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is THE language of the Internet. It is the <strong>
    only</strong> scripting language native to all browsers. If you want your app
  to do something more than just sit there and look pretty, then you're going to need to know <strong>JavaScript
  </strong> to get a job in Web Development.</p>
  <p>JavaScript <strong>is the number one skill</strong> you need today if you want a job in programming.
More than <strong>Ruby</strong>, more than <strong>
    Rails</strong>, and more than <strong>PHP</strong>.</p>
  <p>Along with interaction, <strong>JavaScript</strong> provides mechanisms to
  request data from another location on the Internet. You can use it to parse
  <strong>NASA, NASCAR, and NASDAQ</strong> data.</p>

  <p>Ruby is a <strong>server-side language</strong> and it is used to work
  with databases and write complex software in a <strong>friendly, readable
  </strong> manner.</p>
  <p>In fact, <strong>Ruby</strong> is a programming language <strong>designed</strong>
  for <strong>optimizing developer joy!</strong> It is easy to pick up and is
  powerful enough to take years to master.</p>

  <p>The main underpinning of all web software is the network protocols that lie

<div id="lbRails" class="feather">

  <p>Ruby on Rails was a game-changer. It allows web applications to be built
