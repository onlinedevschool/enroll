Hello <%= @enrollment.first_name %>!

Let's get together some time this week so I can answer any questions you may have about the experience at Devschool and determine if you are a good culture fit for the school.

At Devschool, we pride in not just training you, but getting you hired into that first position on into your new life as a web developer! Now let's get started!

You can view my appointment schedule through this link: http://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1/embed?src=jim@devschool.rocks&ctz=America/Mexico_City

Suggest a time that is good for you where I am free to meet for 30 minutes and I will schedule you.
